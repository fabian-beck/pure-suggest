## Best Practices

- Keep commit or PR messages short and concise
- Avoid functions of minimal size and unnecessary redirection layers
- Don't add comments if something is fixed or not done anymore
- Keep commit messages short and concise, avoid to comment on things that were tested but then not considered
- Add tests whenever appropriate, but try to keep them concise and focused on the most important issues
- Keep commit messages minimal, with small changes only having short messages

## Design Principles

- "selected" identifies through primary color (green/teal), "suggested" through info color (blue)
