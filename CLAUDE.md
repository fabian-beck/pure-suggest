## Best Practices

- Keep commit or PR messages short and concise
- Avoid functions of minimal size and unnecessary redirection layers
- Don't add comments if something is fixed or not done anymore
- Keep commit messages short and concise, avoid to comment on things that were tested but then not considered
- Add tests whenever appropriate, but try to keep them concise and focused on the most important issues
- Keep commit messages minimal, with small changes only having short messages
- Always clean up obsolete code or unnecessary comments
- Act on failing tests immediately to prevent technical debt and maintain code quality
- For a bug, try to first write a test to reproduce it, then fix it
- Generate commit messages based on actual diffs (not memory)

## Design Principles

- "selected" identifies through primary color (turquoise), "suggested" through info color (cyan)
